# JOGL-Utilities
Some basic utilities to help get a JOGL 3D application off the ground. These are just some helper classes for use with [JOGL](http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/).


##### A Shader Manager

-Simplifies the process of loading a file into an OpenGL SL Program

##### A Model Controller

-Parses .obj (wavefront) 3D model files and turns them into a friendly format that can directly rendered and manipulated in OpenGL

##### An Animation Holder

-Allows for the mass upload and animation using a set of .obj files

*Check out my other JOGL projects for examples.*
